# Glossary

The glossary is an aid for translating DreamNET in-game / in-universe terminology. This glossary is not thorough, 
but merely serves to define terms used in other documentation. Entry requests for clarity are welcome.

#### DreamNet
The setting of the game is a text-based virtual reality world. It is a text interface version of its predecessor the 
DreamWeave, and is processed and rendered in text as an emergency measure to preserve it and all of its virtual 
inhabitants.

#### DreamWeave, the
A true to life VL (VirtuLife) experience and world to explore, based on a hardware and software, neural 
translation interface. In other words virtual life that was indistinguishable from real life. Imagine The Matrix as 
a reference point.

#### mage
The player. Not a literal spell-caster, but a hacker that uses a MAGEdeck to connect to DreamNET. Capable of feats 
that non-mage users are not.

#### MAGEdeck
A text-based console with a neural interface, used by hackers to enter and explore DreamNET. The origin of the term 
"mage". Has three modes: VIRTUAL, MAINT and BRAIN, which interface with the LUC, REM and SUB layers of DreamNET 
respectively. Virtual mode is for exploration, maint mode is for software hacking and brain mode is for hardware 
hacking. 

#### user
A human NPC. As opposed to a sentient "AI" NPC.

#### vert (VIRT)
A virtual entity with some level of sentience or the appearance thereof. Levels 0 through 3 for an increasing 
display of sentience. Level 0 refers to no actual sentience (autonomous but pure programming) and level 3 indicates 
full sentience, plus a complete awareness of itself and the reality it inhabits.
