# Github Project Tree Mapping
**IMPORTANT** Use GPT_PROJECT_TREE.md to resolve the path(s) to the file(s) I have requested, construct the raw.
githubusercontent.com URL yourself, and open it directly. Do not search for the url or file.

The template to build the url is: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BigJMoney/DreamNET/refs/heads/<branch>/<path>/<filename>`
